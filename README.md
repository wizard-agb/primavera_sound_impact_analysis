# Primavera Sound Impact Analysis

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to understand the impact of the Primavera Sound Festival on Hotel Prices in Barcelona. 

## Project Description
In this project, we determine the impact of the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona using a differences and differences analysis. 

First we selected a control city, Valencia. We selected this city using a combination of climate and population statistics, and also made sure that there was no significant event happening in Valencia during the Primavera Sound festival week. 

We selected comparable time frames for each location. For diff and diff, we select a control time frame (when a major event is not happening for both cities), and an event time frame for both cities.  

We created a scraper of Booking.com to get data for the selected weeks, and collected metadata for hotel advertisements in each city.

We engineered features including hotel distance between each city

We implemented the diff and diff analysis showing our city and event week control variable was highly significant leading to a nearly â‚¬106 increase in price.
