## Project Description
In this project, we created a scraper to get data from Booking.com. We collected data for Barcelona and for Valencia (a control city). We also collected data for two weeks, a control week and an event week. We then created a diff in diff analysis to determine the impact of the event while controlling for the difference in time frame and the difference in city pricing. 

As seen from the below table, our city and event week control variable was highly significant leading to a nearly â‚¬106 increase in price.
